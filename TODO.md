# Scope

 - small stealth game, 3 levels, afterthought story
 - map
   - interactables:
     - doors
     - valuables (items for the player to get for score)
     - (stretch) objects for the player to hide in (dumpster, locker, etc)
   - (stretch) lighting system
 - player
   - hides around corners and behind objects
   - has melee knockout attack
   - has ranged kill attack
     - one hit kill unaware enemies, 2 hit kill aware enemies
   - can drag downed enemies to a new location
     - (stretch) killed enemies leave a blood splatter to be investigated
 - enemies 
   - patrol routes
   - have vision cones
   - (stretch) notice when objects in vision cone change state from last observation
     - investigate object and surrounding area
   - chase player when spotted in vision cone 
     - alert nearby guards in a radius to also search for player
     - investigate (wander) around the area player was spotted
     - countdown from time last seen, timer ends, return to patrol
   - attack the player with ranged attacks
 - Score
   - guarded or difficult to access items are worth points
   - knocking out guards is worth points
     - leaving guards completely undisturbed is worth more points
   - being spotted deducts points
   - killing guards deducts is 0 or negative points
   - 


## TO DO

- [ ] Create enemy builder/factory
  - [ ] Enemies dynamically create path from point A to B
    - path around collision objects
  - [ ] Enemies cast a vision cone infront of them, and notice when the player is in the cone
    - [ ] Enemies remember the position where the player was last spotted
  - [ ] Enemies path randomly in an area around where the player was last seen
    - until a time interval is passed
  - [ ] enemies can be in various states: pursuit, alert, awake, unconscious, dead
    - [ ] dead: cannot move or interact, if seen by another enemy, that enemy becomes alert
    - [ ] unconscious: same as dead, but will be revived if spotted and interacted with by another enemy.
      - [ ] Can be revived by another enemy
    - [ ] passive: enemy is performing normal behavior ie patrolling routes, standing in position.
    - [ ] suspicious: enemy has seen the player. stops movement until a timer is filled, then enter pursuit
      - [ ] a visual indicator appears to indicate the player being spotted
    - [ ] pursuit: move to the players last seen location. wander around until a timer runs out 
  - [ ] Enemies can emit a ranged projectile to target the player
  - [ ] Enemies can cause other nearby enemies to enter pursuit mode 
    create factory function to add relevant components
    create pathfinding function to move from point A to point B
    - find collidable objects in rectangle of Point A to point B
      - find map which contains collidable objects positions
      - use A*?
    - build path in 45 degree angles might help
    - ensure path does not intersect collidable objects
    - have some randomness in movement. multiple enemies should not move in the exact same line
- Projectile System
  - [x] When a button is push or a function is activated, a projectile is emitted by an entity
    - [x] The projectile travels in a straighlt line towards the target
      - [x] The projectile has working collision
      - [x] The projectile travels at a set speed towards the target
  - [x] The projectile disappears upon collision
  - [ ] the projectile causes a damage event? when colliding with a player or enemy
- Attack System
  - [ ] When a function is activated, an entity determines if there is an entity with health in it's vicinity.
    - [ ] if so, lower the health value
    - [ ] if not, null
- Player
  - [x] Can range attack
    - [ ] Attack one shot kills non-pursuit enemies
    - [ ] The attack two-shot kills pursuit enemies
      - (Half damage on pursuit enemies)
  - [ ] can melee knockout
  - [ ] Can pick up unconscious or dead enemies and relocate them
- (Stretch) Light System
  - [ ] Certain tiles can emit light levels which spread to surrounding tiles
  - [ ] Light levels affect the game graphically
  - [ ] Enemy vision cones are affected by light levels.
